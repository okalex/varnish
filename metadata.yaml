description: |
  Varnish Cache is a state of the art web accelerator written with
  performance and flexibility in mind.  Varnish Cache stores web pages
  in memory so web servers don't have to create the same web page over
  and over again. Varnish serves pages much faster than any application
  server; giving the website a significant speed up.  Some of the
  features include: * A modern design * VCL - a very flexible
  configuration language * Load balancing with health checking of
  backends * Partial support for ESI - Edge Side Includes * URL
  rewriting * Graceful handling of "dead" backends
